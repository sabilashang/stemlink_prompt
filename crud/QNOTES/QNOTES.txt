Build a full-stack web application called “QuickNotes ” where users can securely create, view, edit, and delete personal notes. The app should:

Backend:

Use Supabase as the database and authentication provider.

Implement user authentication (signup, login, logout) using Supabase Auth.

Store notes securely in a table linked to each authenticated user.

Frontend:

Simple, modern UI showing a list of user’s notes.

Allow users to add new notes, edit existing ones, and delete notes.

Include a “login/signup” page and redirect to notes after login.

Security:

Ensure users can only see and modify their own notes.

Use environment variables for Supabase keys.

Tasks (for you to handle internally):

Generate the Supabase table schema for notes and users.

Set up Supabase Auth for secure login/signup.

Generate the frontend code to list, add, edit, and delete notes.

Connect frontend to Supabase using API keys securely.

Include routing so login redirects to notes dashboard.

Make the UI simple but visually appealing.

Output the full codebase ready to run locally, with instructions on how to set environment variables, run the app, and connect to Supabase. Keep it secure, functional, and user-ready.
